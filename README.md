Linux Device Input Switch

was first made to make turning off and on my mouse pad on my laptop for ubuntu easy. but it can be used to turn on and off all human interfaces for linux.

just click on the file and ubuntu will ask if you want to run the script. 

it will display a list of all human interfaces. It will then ask you for the id of the device you want to work will thats on the list. after selecting the id it will ask you to put a 1 to activate 0 to deactivate that device. the command prompt will then close and the device you selected will be activated/deactivated depending on your selection you made. to undo the changes simply run the script again. This script is to make turning on and off human interface devices as simple as entering an id and a 1/0 for turning it on/off.
